A Design Pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It provides a template or guide for solving a particular design issue, 
  without dictating specific code. Essentially, design patterns offer proven solutions to problems that developers face during software development.

Design patterns help:
Improve code readability and maintainability.
Promote best practices for solving common design problems.
Enhance code reusability and flexibility.
Facilitate communication between developers, as they share a common vocabulary for known solutions.

Categories of Design Patterns:
Creational Patterns: Deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.
Examples: Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype.

Structural Patterns: Concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.
Examples: Adapter, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Proxy.

Behavioral Patterns: Focus on communication between objects, how they interact and distribute responsibility.
Examples: Observer, Strategy, Command, Chain of Responsibility, Iterator.

These patterns can make the software system more scalable, easier to understand, and easier to maintain over time.
